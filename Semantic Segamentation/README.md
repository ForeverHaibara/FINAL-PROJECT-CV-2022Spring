## <div align="center">Introduction</div>
This project is aimed to test and compare several pretrained semantic segmentation models. We will use the pretrained model to perform semantic segmentation on a specific video and output the semantically segmented video. In this project, we will first extract the video frame by frame. Then perform semantic segmentation processing on each frame, and finally use the obtained results to generate the resulting video.

Note that the experiments in this project are absolutely carried out on **colab** ,and we will provide you with links which connects to our work on colab. You can see specific output and view videos for example on colab.
