# FINAL-PROJECT-CV-2022Spring
This repository was created for the final project of the computer vision course at Fudan University in the spring semester of 2022.

The project is divided into 3 parts mainly. First, we will test semantic segmantation model pretrained on Cityscapes. Then, we compared training with two different pre-trained models and non-pretrained FasterRCNN.
Finally, we manage to reproduce the vision transformer and training on CIFAR-100 dataset from scratch. 

Note that pretrained models and output videos are all available in our project report and "README" files in this GitHub repository.
