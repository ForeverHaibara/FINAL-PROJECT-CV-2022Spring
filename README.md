# FINAL-PROJECT-CV-2022Spring
This project is created for the final project of computer vision lesson in Fudan University.

The project is divided into 3 parts mainly. First, we will test semantic segmantation model pretrained on Cityscapes. Then, we compared training with two different pre-trained parameters and a model without pre-training in faster-RNN.
Finally, we manage to reproduce the vision transformer and training on CIFAR-100 dataset from scratch. 

Note that pretrained models and result videos are all avalable in our project report and "README" files in GIthub repo.
